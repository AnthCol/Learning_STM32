# Learning_STM32


### Purpose of this respository
I have been wanting to get into embedded development so I bought an STM32F407G-DISC1 development board and started messing with it. 
This repository mainly to document my progress as I learn (it will be filled with beginner projects only). 

Once I am comfortable using the board, any more advanced projects I do will get their own separate repository.
